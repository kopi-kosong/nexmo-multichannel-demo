# nexmo API practice 
My playground of coding and demo. 

On the main page, clicking on the chat icon, a private message will be created between the configured customer_a_number and customer_b_number.

The virtual number serves as a proxy to mask the sender numbers, so that neither of the sender will see the other party's mobile number.


The demo is based on nexmo verify API.
